# Elrond go

The go implementation for the Elrond Network protocol

## Installation and running

In order to join the network as an observer or as a validator, the required steps to **build from source and setup explicitly** are explained below. 
Alternatively, in order to use the Docker Image, jump to [Using the Docker Image](#using-the-docker-image).

### Step 1: install & configure go:
The installation of go should proceed as shown in official golang installation guide https://golang.org/doc/install . In order to run the node, minimum golang version should be 1.12.4.

### Step 2: clone the repository and build the binaries:
The main branch that will be used is the master branch. Alternatively, an older release tag can be used.

```
# set $GOPATH if not set and export to ~/.profile along with Go binary path
$ if [[ $GOPATH=="" ]]; then GOPATH="$HOME/go" fi
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/ElrondNetwork
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ElrondNetwork
$ git clone https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go
$ cd elrond-go && git checkout master
$ GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor
$ cd cmd/node && go build
```
The node depends on the Arwen Virtual Machine, which is automatically managed by the node.

### Step 3: creating the node’s identity:
In order to be registered in the Elrond Network, a node must possess 2 types of (secret key, public key) pairs. One is used to identify the node’s credential used to generate transactions (having the sender field its account address) and the other is used in the process of the block signing. Please note that this is a preliminary mechanism, in the next releases the first (private, public key) pair will be dropped when the staking mechanism will be fully implemented. To build and run the keygenerator, the following commands will need to be run:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/cmd/keygenerator
$ go build
$ ./keygenerator
```

### Start the node 
#### Step 4a: Join Elrond testnet:
Follow the steps outlined [here](https://docs.elrond.com/validators/testnet/config-scripts/). This is because in order to join the testnet you need a specific node configuration.
______
OR
______
#### Step 4b: copying credentials and starting a node in a separate network:
The previous generated .pem file needs to be copied in the same directory where the node binary resides in order to start the node.

```
$  cp validatorKey.pem ./../node/config/
$  cd ../node && ./node
```

The node binary has some flags defined (for a brief description, the user can use --help flag). Those flags can be used to directly alter the configuration values defined in .toml/.json files and can be used when launching more than one instance of the binary. 

### Running the tests	
```	
$ go test ./...	
```

## Compiling new fields in .proto files (should be updated when required PR will be merged in gogo protobuf master branch):
1. Download protoc compiler: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases 
 (if you are running under linux on a x64 you might want to download protoc-3.11.4-linux-x86_64.zip)
2. Expand archive, copy the /include/google folder in /usr/include using <br>
`sudo cp -r google /usr/include`
3. Copy bin/protoc using <br>
`sudo cp protoc  /usr/bin` 
4. Fetch the repo github.com/ElrondNetwork/protobuf
5. Compile gogo slick & copy binary using
```
cd protoc-gen-gogoslick
go build
sudo cp protoc-gen-gogoslick /usr/bin/
```

Done

## Using the Docker Image

The following command runs a Node using the **latest** [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/elrondnetwork/elrond-go-node) and maps a container folder to a local one that holds the necessary configuration:

```
docker run -d -v /absolute/path/to/config/:/data/ elrondnetwork/elrond-go-node:latest \
 --nodes-setup-file="/data/nodesSetup.json" \
 --p2p-config="/data/config/p2p.toml" \
 --validator-key-pem-file="/data/keys/validatorKey.pem"
 ```

 In the snippet above, make sure you adjust the path to a valid configuration folder and also provide the appropriate command line arguments to the Node. For more details go to [Node CLI](https://docs.elrond.com/validators/node-cli).

 In order to run a container using the latest **development** version instead, use the image **`elrondnetwork/elrond-go-node:devlatest`**. Furthermore, in order to use a specific release or tagged branch, use the image **`elrondnetwork/elrond-go-node:<tag>`**.
