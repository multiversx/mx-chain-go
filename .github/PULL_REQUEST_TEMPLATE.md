## Pre-requisites

Based on the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#branches-management) the PR author and the reviewers must check the following requirements are met:
- was the PR targeted to the correct branch?
- if this is a larger feature that probably needs more than one PR, is there a `feat` branch created?
- if this is a `feat` branch merging, do all satellites projects have a proper tag inside `go.mod`?
