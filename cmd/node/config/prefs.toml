   # DestinationShardAsObserver represents the desired shard when running as observer
   # value will be given as string. For example: "0", "1", "15", "metachain"
   # if "disabled" is provided then the node will start in the corresponding shard for its public key or 0 otherwise
   DestinationShardAsObserver = "disabled"

   # NodeDisplayName represents the friendly name a user can pick for his node in the status monitor
   NodeDisplayName = ""

   # Identity represents the keybase's identity
   Identity = ""

   # RedundancyLevel represents the level of redundancy used by the node (-1 = disabled, 0 = main instance (default),
   # 1 = first backup, 2 = second backup, etc.)

   # FullArchive, if enabled, will make the node able to respond to requests from past, old epochs.
   # It is highly recommended to enable this flag on an observer (not on a validator node)

   # PreferredConnections holds an array containing valid ips or peer ids from nodes to connect with (in top of other connections)
   # Example:
   # PreferredConnections = [
   #    "127.0.0.10",
   #    "16Uiu2HAm6yvbp1oZ6zjnWsn9FdRqBSaQkbhELyaThuq48ybdorrr"

   # ConnectionWatcherType represents the type of a connection watcher needed.
   # possible options:
   #  - "disabled" - no connection watching should be made
   #  - "print" - new connection found will be printed in the log file
   ConnectionWatcherType = "disabled"

   # OverridableConfigTomlValues represents an array of items to be overloaded inside config.toml, which can be helpful
   # when performing upgrades that bring a new config toml, and certain flags need to changed.
   # The Path indicates what value to change, while Value represents the new value represented as string. The node operator must make sure
   # to follow the same type of the original value (ex: uint32: "37", float32: "37.0", bool: "true")
   # -------------------------------
   # Un-comment and update the following section in order to enable config values overloading
   # -------------------------------
   # OverridableConfigTomlValues = [
   #    { Path = "StoragePruning.NumEpochsToKeep", Value = "4" },
   #    { Path = "MiniBlocksStorage.Cache.Name", Value = "MiniBlocksStorage" }
