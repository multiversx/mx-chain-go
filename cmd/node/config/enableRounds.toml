# All activation rounds need to be declared as strings containing valid uint64 numbers. All values will be checked in the
# enableRoundsHandler for correctness. The toml parser library can not correctly parse uint64, currently.

# Each activation round definition contains an optional slice of strings. These are useful, for example, when we have
# some exceptions to process in a different manner at a special round (say a block, a transaction, a smart contract result and such)

[RoundActivations]
    # RoundActivations.Example represents an example how to use the round activation
    # mechanism. Replace this with the first real use case

        Options = ["test string1", "test string 2"]
